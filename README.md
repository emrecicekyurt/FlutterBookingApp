# SIRIUS MOBILE APP

A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

After IDE analyzing the code run "pub get" to get related dependencies. You need to install XAMPP in your computer. Go to XAMPP htdocs folder and locate "database" folder from the project. Go to the xampp control panel and start Apache and MySQL from there. Notice that there shouldnt be any running mysql.exe in the bacckground before starting MySQL module of XAMPP. Then go to the your browser and type "http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php". Next you need to create a database called "final". Go to the SQL bench and copy SQL txt file in this directory and paste there. Later on you may go to the your terminal of the project and run "flutter run --no-sound-null-safety" to see the application
